        <i>THE OTHER WORLDLY AURORA borealis,</i> or northern lights, begin high in the Earth's atmosphere at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles - when charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic field. The result is a colorful, dancing light show.

        In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good but not necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth's magnetic field lets more solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in September, when there are pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours of your location here, or by using a sky guide app.
