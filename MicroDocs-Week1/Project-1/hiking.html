        S&oacute;lhemiaj&ouml;kull glacier is an outlet from the mighty M&yacute;yrdalsj&otilde;kull and is surrounded by some of Iceland's most grand volcanoes and during summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only adding to the charm of the location. This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact with the true reason behind the name Ice-land!
